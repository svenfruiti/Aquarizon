# Aquarizon
Aquarizon is an Open World Horror Survival Game, which mostly takes place underwater.
Previously the Project was made public as "Isolated Horizon" or "Limited Horizon" and is in active development since 2019.

This repository is the revive of the old Project with a fresh and clean structure.
